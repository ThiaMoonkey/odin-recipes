    <p>
        This is my favorite homemade pizza, Its simply and delicious with a nice thin crust. 
        This recipe will mostly be for the dough but I will add the topping I prefer to use.
        I will also be providing a quick garlic butter recipe at the end to enjoy your pizza with.

    <h2>Ingredients you'll need</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>The Dough</h3>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <h3>The Toppings</h3>(optional: choose whichever topping you prefer)
        <li><strong>Sauces</strong>: Red Sauce or Spicy chili red sauce</li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses</strong>: Mozzarella shredded and sliced, Parmesan</li>
        <li><strong>Meats</strong>: Pepperoni, Salami</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and Veggies</strong>: Arugula, Basil, Diced Garlic, Oregano, Rosemary, sliced Tomatoes</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>

        <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine bread flour, olive oil, sugar, salt, and yeast mixture in a mixing bowl; stir well to combine. Beat until a stiff dough has formed. Cover the bowl; let rise at room temperature until dough doubles in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if dough is too sticky.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a thin crust(I like to brush the dough with garlic oil but you can use olive or skip this part). Cover with your favorite sauce and toppings. </li>
        <li>Bake pizza in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>

    </ol>

<h3>Garlic butter dipping sauce</h3>
<h4>You'll need:</h4>   
    <ul>

        <li>butter</li>
        <li>garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt(optional)</li>
    
    </ul>

    <ol>

        <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat.</li>
        <li>Once the butter is completely melted, remove from heat and use a spoon to carefully remove the foamy layer on top; discarding foam.</li>
        <li>Whisk in garlic powder and salt, if using.</li>
        <li>Transfer to individual dipping bowls.</li>
