<li><strong>Milk</strong>: 1tbsp milk; 1 cup of Milk</li>
<li><strong>Vanilla extract</strong>: ½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li><strong>Spices</strong>: ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 pinch ground nutmeg, </li>

<li><strong>Oats</strong>: ½ cup rolled oats</li>
<li><strong>Syrup</strong>:1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
<li><strong>Peanut Butter</strong>: 1 tablespoon peanut butter, or to taste</li>
<li><strong>Banana</strong>: 1 banana, sliced or ½ banana, sliced</li>

1 large egg

1 tablespoon milk

1 cup milk, or more as needed

½ teaspoon vanilla extract

¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

1 pinch salt

1 pinch ground nutmeg

½ cup rolled oats

1 tablespoon maple syrup

1 tablespoon peanut butter, or to taste

½ banana, sliced




Directions
Whisk egg with 1 tablespoon milk in a small bowl. Set aside.

Bring 1 cup milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg to a boil in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring often. Mix in oats and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.

Pour beaten egg mixture slowly into the oats, stirring constantly. Continue cooking until egg is fully cooked and oatmeal is very thick and creamy, about 5 minutes. Add additional milk if oatmeal gets too thick.

Pour oatmeal into a heat-proof bowl; mix in maple syrup and peanut butter. Top with banana slices and crumbled bacon.

Cook's Note:
This can be prepared the night before. Make the oatmeal, pour it into a heat- safe container, and store in the fridge. When ready to eat, microwave oatmeal until warm (extra milk may be needed, as oatmeal thickens substantially overnight), then top with cooked bacon and banana slices.
