Recipe Project

This is my first project for the Odin course. 
I will be creating a recipes webpage with ingredients list and step by step guides.
I will be using html, css, and javascript for this project.
This will test the knowledge I have learned thus far and help me to better my skill in hands-on learning rather than just reading. 
I hope I am able to make a professional but personally styled webpage that I would and enjoy and be proud of.
